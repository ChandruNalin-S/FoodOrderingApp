# React hooks-> it is normal Javascript utils/ build in functions and it was written by Facebook developer
-> this hooks present in react file in node_modules.
->purpose: to create a powerful variable(state variable) or function to change or modify the data and stored in it.
->there are many hooks concept in react but these two are using lot of time in developing application react.
  ->useState() - Superpowerful state variable in react. (80%) using in react.
  ->useEffect() = (20%) using in react.

# rendering -> whenever the state variable is changes or update, then react will re-render the component

# How web app and UI app fetch the data from the backend or API and there are two approach to fetch the data.
->1-Approach. loads->API(wait for 500ms to get the data and then)-> render (but it is poor approach to make Webapps that's why we are using second approach which are using in react.).

->2-Approach. loads-> render->API(call the data from backend and then)-> re-render the UI and website(that's why we are always using approach to make webapps).


# useEffect function will work, when the component render the jsx code inside it, then the useEffect function will run the code inside it. (after rendering of jsx inside the component, the useeffect function will executed)

# fetching data from backend using API by fetch function which was provide by JSEngine in browser. when we fetch the data in "network tab" and loading in our localHost then we got some error called "CROS" it standard for "Cross-Origin-Resource Sharing", why we are getting these error, because "the browser is not allowing us to access the API due to mismatching of localHost origin and backend origin", to slow this conflicts or issue we can use extension called cros chrome extension.

# Shimmer UI-> A shimmer UI is a version of the UI that doesnâ€™t contain actual content, but instead mimics the layout and shapes of the content that will eventually appear. It uses a gradient animation that creates a shimmering effect over the placeholders, giving the user a sense of motion and progress.


# Routing -> nav to one component page to another component page and we have to install react-router-dom, this is a library which have Routing function to create router in our app. 
-> this routing function are commonly using to create routing and config in our app.
  ->createBrowserRouter -> to create router and we have to give some information to config the router like path.
  ->RouterProvider -> it will render all the path which is inside in the createBrowserRouter([...]);
  ->useRouteError -> it is a function(hook) and provide by react-router-dom library, through we can display more info about the error and we can config/create our own error page/component, when they are nav to some other page which is not in the app. 


# 2 types of routing:
  -> client side routing. -> it is a single page application and replacing the component and not reloading the entire page.
  -> server side routing. -> it is traditional routing, why because, whenever we click the home page or about page, the network call will occur and get the data of clicked page like home.html or about.html from server.  



# <button onClick={()=>{
          // NEVER EVER DO UPDATE STATE VARIABLE DIRECTLY likr this->this.state.count = this.state.count + 1(this one is wrong way to update state variable lik this and will cause consistency in data); 

          this.setState({// setState function we can use any where inside the class based component. through this function we can update the count.
            count:this.state.count + 1
          })
          
        }>Count Increase</button>

# Important:" React Life Cycle methods in class based component:
  -> there are two phase in react life cycle in class based component:
      (mounting)/loading
      -> Render Phase
              -> constructor
              -> render
      -> Commit Phase
              -> Dom manipulation after render the component and reconciliation, find out the different btw previse virtual dom and new virtual dom, compare the dom and then updated the dom in website.
              ->componentDidMount()-> this function will ensure that component is loaded/mount in the website.
              if the state variable is update then it will render again and call the function called componentDidUpdate();
              ->componentDidUpdate()-> this function will ensure that component is updated in the website.
              ->componentWillUnMount()->  this function will stop/clear the component componentDidMount, if u are moving another page, why because if u not stop/clear then it will run background, so we have to clear the mess.(due to this is single page application)but (server based application)it won't happen/occur this mess because the page is reloading.

# note:"In react life cycle envirnoment"

 -> react always batch the render phase first and batch the commit phase.
 for example: In about component is a parent component and there are three child component is called.
 -> First, batch all render phase in each and every component and then, batch all commit phase in each and every component after updated in dom and call the componentDidMount()-> for the component is loaded.        
  
 In console how the component is working:

 ->Parent constructor
 ->Parent render
      (Render Phase- batch all render phase->constructor and render function)
      ->first (class)child constructor
      ->first(class)child render
      ->second(class)child constructor
      ->second (class)child render
      ->third (class)child constructor
      ->third (class)child render

      (Commit Phase- after render phase, the dom is updated and call the componentDidMount())
      ->first (class)child did mount
      ->second (class)child did mount
      ->third (class)child did mount
->Parent did mount

# Never ever compare react life cycle methods to functional component.
